# Router setup and configuration

## Objective

- Setup react router for navigation between different pages in the application.
- Define routes for dashboard, profile, settings, expenses, reports, help and auth pages (login, signup, forgot password).
- Implement protected routes for authenticated users.
- Create a navigation aside bar for easy access to different sections of the app.
- Ensure smooth transitions between pages with loading indicators.

## Technologies

- React Router v7
- React Context API or Redux for state management
- React Suspense for lazy loading components
- CSS-in-JS or styled-components for styling the navigation bar
- Axios or Fetch API for data fetching
- React Hooks for managing component state and side effects
- JWT or OAuth for authentication
- React Testing Library and Jest for testing components and routes
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting
- Webpack or Vite for module bundling and development server

## Steps to Implement

1. Install React Router and necessary dependencies.
2. Create a Router component to define all routes.
3. Implement protected routes using a higher-order component or custom hook.
4. Design and implement the navigation aside bar with links to different sections.
5. Add loading indicators for smooth transitions between pages.
6. Test all routes and navigation functionality.
7. Optimize performance with lazy loading and code splitting.
8. Ensure responsiveness and accessibility of the navigation bar.
9. Document the routing structure and usage for future reference.
10. Deploy the application and monitor for any routing issues.

## Install react router and necessary dependencies

- Run `npm install react-router-dom` to install React Router.
- Install any additional libraries needed for state management and authentication.
- Set up the project structure for routing components.
- Create a basic Router component to start defining routes.
- Test the initial setup by navigating to a few sample routes.
- Document the installation and setup process for future reference.
